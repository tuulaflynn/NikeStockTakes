# finalCapstone

#### Point/ importance of the project: 
finalCapstone project uses object-oriented programming to create a solution to optimise
stock-takes for Nike warehouses. 

#### Brief description of project: 
The project is formed of a menu where users can choose various options to analyse and edit data stored from Nike (shoe) warehouses.

#### More detailed description the project does:
Each Nike warehouse stores one style of shoe.
The stock-take for a warehouse cotains the following data about the shoe they store:
- Country the warehouse is in
- Code of the shoe
- Product name of the shoe
- Cost of the shoe
- Quantity of shoes
- Value of the shoe

The database for the stock-takes is inventory.txt. 
Each line of the file gives the stock-take for one warehouse (excluding the first line which is the headers for the data).

The project enables users (like store managers) to:
* Search for shoes by code
* Determine which shoes have the lowest quantity with option to restock
* Determine the shoes with the highest quantity
* Calculate the value of stock for each warehouse 
* Capture data about a new stock-take for a shoe from the user (this does not get added to the database yet).
* View all stock-takes

#### Installation
Download the program inventory.py and the database inventory.txt and store them in the same folder.
Run the program to being to use!

#### Usage
The program runs on a looping main menu. 
Input (type and enter) the number next to the option you'd like at the main menu.
Input 7 on the main menu to exit the program.
